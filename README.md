# Tic-Tac-Tow

This is your standard game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Do I really
need to explain how the game plays? ðŸ˜Š

The name of the game **Tic-Tac-Tow** was spelled incorrectly
on purpose. I started another project with the correct spelling,
but how to start that project over and did not want to delete.

The goal of this project was to utilize factory functions and IIFE's.

Enjoy the game play!
